## Introduction

The E-commerce Price Comparison Tool is a Python project that utilizes web scraping libraries like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy and data analysis libraries like Pandas to extract and compare product information from various online retailers.

## Setup

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize a new Git repository**: Initialize a new Git repository locally to manage your project's version control. You can do this by navigating to your project directory in the terminal and running the following command:

    ```bash
    git init
    ```

2. **Create a Python Script**: Create a new Python script (e.g., `price_comparison.py`) where the main functionality will reside.

3. **Set up a Virtual Environment**: It's recommended to work within a virtual environment to isolate your project's dependencies. You can create and activate a virtual environment using the following commands:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv Ecomm\ Price\ Comparison
    cd Ecomm\ Price\ Comparison/
    source Scripts/activate  # Activate the virtual environment
    ```

    After activating your virtual environment, you can list the files and directories using the following command:

    ```bash
    ls -la
    ```

4. **Open in Visual Studio Code**: You can open the project directory in Visual Studio Code by running the following command:

    ```bash
    code .
    ```
5. **Open in Visual Studio Code**: You can open the `price_comparison.py` script in Visual Studio Code directly by running the following command:

    ```bash
    code price_comparison.py
    ```

## Install Dependencies

Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4 scrapy pandas
```
